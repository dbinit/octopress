Hello, I’m David.

I’m a Christian, husband, father, and programmer, among other things.

I grew up in Chile, though I’m originally from the Dallas, Texas area. I now
reside with my wife and 1-year-old daughter in Fort Worth, Texas.

I have a passion for computers and programming. I love solving problems and
designing elegant solutions.

I am mostly self-taught through an abundance of real-world experience. I'm
always up for a challenge and learning new things, which usually leads to me
being involved in all aspects of an IT department.

Even though I've done everything from networking and system administration to
producing live web video broadcasts with thousands of viewers, programming has
always been the most fulfilling.

Over the last couple years I haven't been able to get enough of Python
and JavaScript. I've been having a lot of fun with the Django web framework in
particular.
