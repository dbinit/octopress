I'm not a big fan of GUIs for version control software. On Windows I've tried
all the Tortoise incarnations, but they always just seem to slow me down. The
built in Git GUI was decent but, at the end of the day, it was always easier
to just use the command line.

When I switched to using a Mac full time, I didn't spend much time looking. I
installed [MacHg](http://jasonfharris.com/machg/) and [GitHub for Mac](http://mac.github.com/)
but never used them. I was, though, having trouble finding a good Mac file
comparison tool. On Windows I'd always been relatively happy with
[Beyond Compare](http://www.scootersoftware.com/). It was fast and has a ton
of features.

So, I still haven't found a decent comparison tool for Mac, but I did stumble
onto a great VCS GUI. [SourceTree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) has been
absolutely great to work with. I pretty much have it open full time as there's
no need to switch between apps (it does Git, Mercurial, and SVN). It just
happens to have built-in integration for [GitHub](http://github.com/),
[BitBucket](http://bitbucket.org/), and [Kiln](http://www.fogcreek.com/kiln/)
(of which I use all three). And, as far as I can tell, it's
[free](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/register-free/).

If you're on a Mac, I highly recommend it.
